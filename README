Hello everyone, this is my first project here, so, I'm glad to share it with everyone

It's a copy/tribute to legendary game Soko-Ban (1984) but just one level (level 1 lol), I coded it all with Pygame
from Python (only Functional Programmation stuff), I've not used CLASSES on it.
 
If someone wants to suggest me anything, go ahead, I'm still learning on my own. 

Thanks.

PS: all images are from Internet, I don't know how to make it
